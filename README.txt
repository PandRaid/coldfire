BUILDING ------------------------------------------------------------
   The platform executable and the assembler and/or application source 
   files are built using the Makefile
   
   > make
   
RUNNING --------------------------------------------------------------
    The example is executed by running the platform executable and
    passing the elf file as the first argument
    
    > ./platform.exe application.elf
    
    NOTE: Each example may have both or either an assembler or C based
    application file.
